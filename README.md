# TheBricksStateMachiene
is the implementation of a state machine for the game [Cherry Jump](http://cherryjump.de).

The class BrickStateMachine in BrickStateMachiene.cs is written in such a way that it can be transferred 1:1 into the Unity project Cherry Jump and is responsible for how (height and sequence) the bricks are randomly generated.
