# TheBricksStateMachine
is the implementation of a state machine for the game [Cherry Jump as web game](http://cherryjump.de) and on GitHub from [Maeve Butler](https://github.com/MaeveCake/CherryJump) and [@dinchensart](https://twitter.com/dinchensart).

The class BrickStateMachine in BrickStateMachiene.cs is written in such a way that it can be transferred 1:1 into the Unity project Cherry Jump and is responsible for how (height and sequence) the bricks are randomly generated.
